I have taken and passed the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-533.aspx" target="_blank">70-533 Implementing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions exam</a> recently. The exam covers a wide range of topics related to virtual machines, cloud services, web apps etc and can seem overwhelming for many candidates. That is why I believe that good preparation is a key for passing the exam. In this blog post I will describe how I have prepared for the exam, including the resources I have used and found useful. 

#### **Skills Measured**
Here is a breakdown of the exam objectives:
- Design and Implement Azure App Service Apps (10-15%)
- Create and Manage Azure Resource Manager Virtual Machines (20-25%)
- Design and Implement a Storage Strategy (10-15%)
- Implement Virtual Networks (15-20%)
- Design and Deploy ARM Templates (10-15%)
- Manage Azure Security and Recovery Services (25-30%)
- Manage Azure Operations (5-10%)
- Manage Azure Identities (5-10%)

_Note: The percentages indicate the relative weight of each major topic area on the exam._

#### **Preparation**
There are many resources that you can use to gain a good understanding of the topics covered in this exam. Do not rely on only one resource, use at least two different resources. I have laid out below the methods and resources I have used during my preparation.

__The official exam reference book__
<br />The official reference book <a href="http://a.co/d/d0Y3nlm" target="_blank">“Exam Ref 70-533: Implementing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions”</a> was updated to a second edition a few months ago and includes many of the newly added features. While it covers all major exam topics, I highly advise you to supplement it with other materials to gain more in-depth knowledge on the services that Microsoft Azure provides. Also, make sure to check out the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/4/8/848DD46A-05F2-4021-A118-036FC06647C5/533_OD_Changes.pdf">Exam 533 change document</a> which includes changes to the exam content that was updated on March 29th.

__Documentation__
<br />The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Documentation</a> is perhaps the most comprehensive and up-to-date resource available on the web. It provides detailed information about Azure services and also, includes samples and tutorials that could be pretty useful. What is more, there are dozens of pre-defined <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/resources/templates/" target="_blank">Azure QuickStart Templates</a> that you can play around with and customise. 

__Videos__
<br />
- MVA: Microsoft Virtual Academy
<br />There are a few good MVA videos on Azure and I recommend watching them. One of them is the <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/certification-exam-overview-70533-implementing-microsoft-azure-infrastructure-solutions-17405" target="_blank" style="color:	#00008B">Certification Exam Overview</a> which captures the main concepts in Azure.
- Azure Friday
<br /><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/resources/videos/azure-friday/" target="_blank" style="color:	#00008B">Azure Friday</a> is a recurring Friday video series that will take you through the basics of creating and managing services in Azure. By following it, you can also keep up with the Azure features that have been introduced recently.

__Practice tests__
<br />While there are many practice tests available on the web, I used the <a href="https://uk.mindhub.com/70-533-implementing-microsoft-azure-infrastructure/p/MU-70-533" target="_blank">Microsoft Official Practice Test by MeasureUp</a>. I highly recommend taking practice tests as it helps you get used to the examination style. Moreover, by taking the practice test, you can identify your weak areas and focus on them.
The practice test might be harder than the actual exam, but do not take that for granted. Instead, I highly recommend taking the practice exam many times, each time with different number of questions, sections and different durations.

__Training Courses__
<br />There are many training courses that you can use to expand your knowledge about Azure. As I did not have any previous experience with Azure, I attended a 5-day <a href="https://www.qa.com/training-courses/technical-it-training/microsoft/microsoft-azure/implementing-microsoft-azure-infrastructure-solutions" target="_blank">QA training course</a> which was really informative and the instructor was knowledgeable and helpful. There was a lab session after each module which was a really good exercise and helped me understand the subject better. If you choose this option, I highly recommend attending the classroom training at one of the training centres rather than attending remotely as it is a change of scenery and also, allows you to entirely focus on the subject.

#### **Tips**
- Create a table that contains all the information that is covered in this exam. Identify the examined topics you are most familiar with and the ones you do not have much knowledge about. Check topics off when you finish revising them. Manage your time efficiently and allocate more time on the topics that you find more difficult.
- If you do not have an Azure subscription, check if your organisation has <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/" target="_blank" style="color:#00008B">Visual Studio subscriptions</a>  for its employees which gives you a $150 monthly credit for Azure. Alternatively, you can sign up for a free trial of Azure.
- You’d better get hands-on experience with Azure in addition to all the knowledge gained. Go to the Azure portal and play around with the different services.
- Be familiar with the PowerShell cmdlets that are used to create and manage resources and configure services in Azure.
- Be familiar with the order of the steps that need to be followed when configuring various services in Azure.
- Be familiar with the structure and syntax of an ARM template.

I hope you find this information useful. Good luck to anyone who takes this exam!
